## For AI agents and developers
- Use this as the entrypoint for educational goals and level progression.
- Read `docs/curriculum/progression.md` before designing or modifying levels.
- Keep curriculum changes consistent with the C↔RPG metaphors in `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md`.
- Confirm the level unlock/completion flow in `docs/logic-mindmap.md` when changing progression rules or save-state handling.
