# Code Warrior Technical Decisions

## For AI agents and developers
- Use this to understand why specific architectural choices were made.
- Prefer aligning with accepted ADRs instead of introducing new patterns by default.
- Propose changes only when you can articulate how they affect existing decisions.
- Cross-check runtime flow implications against `docs/logic-mindmap.md` so ADR updates stay consistent with implemented routes and state handling.
